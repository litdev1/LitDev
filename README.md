LitDev Extension for Small Basic

## Website Update

Following a downturn in my Small Basic activity after the loss of the MS Forum, the LitDev website lapsed.  I have reinstated it; unfortunately it needed a new domain name.

:boom: **The new website is [litdev.uk](http://litdev.uk)** :boom:

If you use SB-Prime IDE with Extension Manager, you may download an updated version of [SB-Prime](http://litdev.uk/downloads/SB-Prime.zip) from the website to be compitible with the new website domain name.

I have also created an initial [Small Basic forum](https://litdev.uk/mybb) which is a good place to ask questions.
